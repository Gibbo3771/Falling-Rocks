This was my second game that I made using the LibGDX framework, I originally jumped right into Pong which don't get me wrong, worked but seemed terrible so I decided to go back to basics and actually do something simple. So here we have it, falling rocks.

You play a cave explorer called Jim, after falling into a trench and upsetting the natural balance of the cave, you soon realise that you have caused a landslide of rocks and gems. Avoid the rocks and college the gems, don't let Jim get crushed by too many rocks!
